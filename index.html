      <h2> Functions </h2>
      <h3> What is a function? </h3>
      <p>
        A function is basically a block of code that does one particular thing
        Setup() and draw() that you have been using till now are also functions! setup() contains a block of code that executes only once in the beginning and draw() contains a block of code that executes in a loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly we are now going to write our own functions!
        Imagine if you want to draw a the target logo where your cursor is, each time you pressed your key - you could do the below
      </p>
      <script type="text/p5">
      function setup() {
        createCanvas(400, 400);
        background(220);
      }
      function draw() {

      }
      function mousePressed() {
        fill("red");
        ellipse(mouseX,mouseY, 30, 30);
        fill("white");
        ellipse(mouseX,mouseY, 20, 20);
        fill("red");
        ellipse(mouseX,mouseY, 10, 10);
      }
      </script>
      <p>
        or you could <b>define</b> a function called <b>drawTarget</b> and call it each time press the mouse, like the below.
      </p>
      <script type="text/p5">
      function setup() {
        createCanvas(400, 400);
        background(220);
      }
      function draw() {

      }
      function mousePressed() {
        drawTarget();
      }
      function drawTarget() {
        fill("red");
        ellipse(mouseX,mouseY, 30, 30);
        fill("white");
        ellipse(mouseX,mouseY, 20, 20);
        fill("red");
        ellipse(mouseX,mouseY, 10, 10);
      }
      </script>
      <p> Functions are however maily used to reduce repetetive code. Imagine if you wanted 20 owls on your screen. Drawing 20 owls from the beginning is not fun :| . Instead you can write a function the will draw an owl and then call that function 20 times! You can even pass a parameter to the function telling it where to draw.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, let's say you had to draw 3 target logos all over the page
      </p>
      <script type="text/p5">
      function setup() {
        createCanvas(400, 400);
        background(220);

        //first logo
        fill("red");
        ellipse(150,150, 30, 30);
        fill("white");
        ellipse(150,150, 20, 20);
        fill("red");
        ellipse(150,150, 10, 10);

        //second logo
        fill("red");
        ellipse(200,200, 30, 30);
        fill("white");
        ellipse(200,200, 20, 20);
        fill("red");
        ellipse(200,200, 10, 10);

        //third logo
        fill("red");
        ellipse(250,250, 30, 30);
        fill("white");
        ellipse(250,250, 20, 20);
        fill("red");
        ellipse(250,250, 10, 10);
      }

      </script>

      <p>
        Or you could write a function like the below called 'drawTarget'
      </p>
      <script type="text/p5">
      function setup() {
        createCanvas(400, 400);
        background(220);

        //first logo
        drawTarget(150,150);

        //second logo
        drawTarget(200,200);

        //third logo
        drawTarget(250,250);
      }


      function drawTarget(x,y) {
        fill("red");
        ellipse(x,y, 30, 30);
        fill("white");
        ellipse(x,y, 20, 20);
        fill("red");
        ellipse(x,y, 10, 10);
      }
      </script>

      <h2> textSize() </h2>
      <p>
        So, now since you can now write text using the text() function - we can make a fun program.
      </p>
      <p>
          There is another function called textSize(size) - it determines the size of the text that you type.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try this example
      </p>
      <script type="text/p5">
      function setup() {
        createCanvas(400, 400);
      	background(220);
      	textSize(12);
      	text("Hello", 50 ,25);
      	textSize(16);
      	text("Hello", 50, 50);
      	textSize(20);
      	text("Hello", 50,75);
      	//notice how I am increasing the y position by the same amount as the font size
      }
      function draw() {

      }
      </script>
      <p>
        Awesome!
        So, to try all this together along with for loop.
        Write a program so that you get the below output :)

      <h2> Plain If Else Block </h2>
      <p>
        There are sometimes where you want an instruction executed IF a certain condition is met.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance,
      </p>
      <textarea>
        <b>If</b> the milk is old, <b>boil it</b>
        <b>else</b>  do nothing
      </textarea>
      <p>
        Similarly, in code, we have instances where we want certain instructions carried out if a condition is met
      </p>
      <p>
        Example,
      </p>
      <textarea>
        If the number is 10
        Draw a circle
        Else
        Draw a square
      </textarea>
      <p>
        The code for this is as follows
      </p>
      <textarea>
        if ( condition ) {
         // do something
        }

        else {
         do something else
        }
      </textarea>
        For example, try this code, and change the value of i and see how the output changes
      <script type="text/p5">
        var i =10;
        function setup() {
          createCanvas(400,400);
          fill(255,0,0);
          if(i == 10) {
            ellipse(20,20,20,20);
          }
          else {
            rect(20,20,20,20);
          }
        }
      </script>
      <p>
        <b> Things to note: </b>
        <ul>
          <li>When we are checking equality inside an if statement, we use to 2 equal to signs -> ==</li>
          <li> To check if something is NOT equal to , we do this -> != </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Examples to try </b>
        <ul>
          <li> Write a for loop that counts from 1 to 10. <br>
            When i is equal to 5, draw a square, else always draw a circle. ( Draw them all next to each other)</li>
          <li> Draw 10 rectangles on the screen, from left to right.
            <br>
            Make the first 5 rectangles red and the next 5 blue.
            <br>
            Use for loop and if else statements </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>  If Else-if blocks </h2>
      <p>
        This is a syntax used when there are multiple conditions you want to check for.
      </p>

        For instance,
      </p>
      <textarea>
        If the milk is from yesterday, boil it

        In our programs, it could be something like this -
      </p>

      <textarea>
        If the number is 10
        Draw a red circle
        Else if the number is 20

        Else
        Draw a green circle

      <p>
        The last <b>else</b> is usually what catches all OTHER conditions that you have not specified.
      </p>
      <textarea>
        The code for this is as follows
        if ( condition ) {
